# Forrest's game dev portfolio
this sure has been a fun year in Game Dev 1! making the Space Game And Lunacy was an expirience like none other.

my space game is unique, because I use turrets ant normal lazers. You won't run out of lazers, but if you have turrets, which you have a limited amount of, you can shoot a bigger blast. the artwork is strange, I know, but that is kind of the theme of the game.

before the game was started, I biult the spaceship in javascript and based it off of the _Epoch_, A flying time machine in _Chrono Trigger._ one of the asteroids seen in ghe game, namely 8-bit Volcano, came from a very incomplete game, which awas the first game I made in GameDev 1. the game's name was just ShapeGame, in which one object (in my game, a plane) tries to catch another object (the asteroid) before it shrinks to a too small of a size. the asteroid was inspired from a scene in _Chrono Trigger_ where tha game's antagonist, Lavos, lands on earth in the form of a red and black asteroid. the other asteroids were made on the spot. Spahgetti on Simon (the asteroid) was based off of, well, Simon. the third asteroid had no inspiration of any kind.

Lunacy was also a fun project. however, one thing that we struggled with was making things one at a time. at this point, the game is still incomplete. I learne a lot from Designing Lunacy, Including how to organize your time.
