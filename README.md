this sure has been a fun year in Game Dev 1! making the Space Game And Lunacy was an expirience like none other.

my space game is unique, because I use turrets ant normal lazers. You won't run out of lazers, but if you have turrets, which you have a limited amount of, you can shoot a bigger blast. the artwork is strange, I know, but that is kind of the theme of the game.
